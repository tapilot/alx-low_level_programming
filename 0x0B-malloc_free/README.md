Difference between Automatic and Dynamic Allocation
Learn about the key distinctions between automatic (stack) allocation and dynamic (heap) allocation. Understand when to use each method and how they impact your programs.

Malloc and Free: How to Use Them
Discover the functions malloc and free and their significance in dynamically allocating and deallocating memory. This section provides practical examples and best practices for utilizing these functions.

Why and When to Use Malloc
Explore the motivations behind choosing dynamic memory allocation (malloc). Understand the scenarios in which dynamic allocation is advantageous, providing flexibility in memory management.

Using Valgrind for Memory Leak Detection
Learn how to use Valgrind, a powerful tool, to detect and rectify memory leaks and other memory-related issues in C and C++ programs. Find out how to incorporate Valgrind into your debugging process.
